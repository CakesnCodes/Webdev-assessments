  <dl class="boxes">
    <dt><h2 id="dumb"><strong>Molly Blyndeff</strong> (Voiced by Dani Chambers)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>The main protagonist of the Museum Break In Arc,<br> a beleaguered 12-year-old girl who runs a family toy store in place of her neglectful father and sister. She winds up getting locked in the Sweet Jazz Museum after hours during a school trip and is promptly roped into an insane plot over a mysterious amulet with the power to steal people's epithets.
      <br><br>
      Her epithet, ★Dumb★, mutes and simplifies things. This has a few varying applications, from creating a bubble that prevents sound from traveling in or out, to lowering the damage of an attack, to literally making someone dumber.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <br>
    <dt><h2 id="soup"><strong>Giovanni Potage</strong> (Voiced by Kyle Ignezi)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A recently promoted Captain in the Banzai Blasters, who broke into the Sweet Jazz Museum with no real goal besides "stealing artifacts". Despite being a self-proclaimed evil villain, he's actually very kind and compassionate, 
    especially toward his minions, and he and Molly quickly become friends after getting to know one another.
      <br>
      <br>
      His epithet, ★Soup★, gives him power over…well, soup. It may sound like a lame power, but with five stars in Creativity, Giovanni makes good use of it.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt><h2 id="drowsy"><strong><ins>Dr.</ins> Sylvester 'Sylvie' Ashling</strong> (Voiced by Zach Maher)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A child savant who earned a doctorate in psychology at the age of fifteen. 
    Sylvester “Sylvie” Ashling has a fascination with how epithets affect a person’s mental health. 
    He means well, but he’s much better at reading books than reading people and comes across as a brat sometimes.
    <br><br>
      Sylvie can use his epithet, ★Drowsy★, to examine his patients’ dreams up close and personal.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt><h2 id="fragile"><strong>Mera Salamin</strong> (Voiced by Lindsay Sheppard)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>Short in terms of both temper and height, this museum tour guide doesn’t get along with anyone besides her gigantic bodyguard Indus. 
    Her personality is as icy as her stare. She seems oddly accident-prone, for some reason…</dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="BARRIER"><strong>Indus Tarbella</strong> (Voiced by Anthony Sardinha)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>Mera's incredibly loyal, buff, and dim-witted bodyguard.
      <br><br>
      His epithet, ★BARRIER★, allows him to make, you guessed it, BARRIERS! 
    </dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="parapet"><strong>Percival 'Percy' King</strong> (Voiced by Sandra Espinoza)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>The main protagonist of the second arc, a police detective. 
    She spearheads the investigation over the Arsene Amulet burglary, which leads her to the backwater town of Redwood Run.
      <br><br>
      Her epithet, ★Parapet★, gives her the ability to construct small, magical buildings using the material around her.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt><h2 id="goldbricker"><strong>Ramsey Murdoch</strong> (Voiced by William Sopp)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A freelance appraiser for the criminal underworld and a freelance artist in his off-time. 
    Ramsey is the guy to go to when you need to know how valuable whatever you just stole is. <br>Despite his seedy appearance, he’s actually a pretty reliable guy.
    <br>
       His epithet, ★Goldbricker★, lets him turn anything he touches into gold. He prefers using this ability to prank people rather than making money.
    </dd> 
    <br>
    <dt><h2 id="sundial"><strong>Zora Salazar</strong> (Voiced by Dawn M. Bennett)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A bounty-hunting cowgirl who's been sent to retrieve the Arsene Amulet.</dd>
