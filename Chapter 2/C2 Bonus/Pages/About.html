  <p><strong>Epithet Erased</strong> is an action-comedy series created by <em>Brendan "JelloApocalypse" Blaber</em> on YouTube.<br><br>It is set in a world where one out of every five people are born with an <em>'Epithet'</em>, a word that is inscribed onto their very soul that grants them various abilities depending on to word. Epithets are random, meaning one can have common words like ★Soup★ or ★Barrier★ to rare ones like ★Parapet★ or ★Augment★, however, it's up to the users to train these epithets to become powerful</p>

  <p>The series began as a collection of 7 animated episodes released on VRV (and later released on YouTube) in 2019, with future intallments, such as <em>Prison of Plastic</em>, coming in the form of Light Novels, and Audiobooks</p>
