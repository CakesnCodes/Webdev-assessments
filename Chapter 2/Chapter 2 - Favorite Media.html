  <br>
  <p><strong>Epithet Erased</strong> is an action-comedy series created by <em>Brendan "JelloApocalypse" Blaber</em> on YouTube.<br><br>It is set in a world where one out of every five people are born with an <em>'Epithet'</em>, a word that is inscribed onto their very soul that grants them various abilities depending on to word. Epithets are random, meaning one can have common words like <em>★Soup★</em> or <em>★Barrier★</em> to rare ones like ★Parapet★ or ★Augment★, however, it's up to the users to train these epithets to become powerful</p>

  <p>The series began as a collection of 7 animated episodes released on VRV (and later released on YouTube) in 2019, with future intallments, such as <em>Prison of Plastic</em>, coming in the form of Light Novels, and Audiobooks</p>

    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="dumb"><strong>Molly Blyndeff</strong> (Voiced by Dani Chambers)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>The main protagonist of the Museum Break In Arc,<br> a beleaguered 12-year-old girl who runs a family toy store in place of her neglectful father and sister. She winds up getting locked in the Sweet Jazz Museum after hours during a school trip and is promptly roped into an insane plot over a mysterious amulet with the power to steal people's epithets.
      <br><br>
      Her epithet, <strong>★Dumb★</strong>, mutes and simplifies things. This has a few varying applications, from creating a bubble that prevents sound from traveling in or out, to lowering the damage of an attack, to literally making someone dumber.
    </dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="soup"><strong>Giovanni Potage</strong> (Voiced by Kyle Ignezi)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A recently promoted Captain in the Banzai Blasters, who broke into the Sweet Jazz Museum with no real goal besides "stealing artifacts". Despite being a self-proclaimed evil villain, he's actually very kind and compassionate, 
    especially toward his minions, and he and Molly quickly become friends after getting to know one another.
      <br><br>
      His epithet, <strong>★Soup★</strong>, gives him power over…well, soup. It may sound like a lame power, but with five stars in Creativity, Giovanni makes good use of it.
    </dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="drowsy"><strong><ins>Dr.</ins> Sylvester 'Sylvie' Ashling</strong> (Voiced by Zach Maher)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A child savant who earned a doctorate in psychology at the age of fifteen. 
    Sylvester “Sylvie” Ashling has a fascination with how epithets affect a person’s mental health. 
    He means well, but he’s much better at reading books than reading people and comes across as a brat sometimes.
    <br><br>
      Sylvie can use his epithet, <strong>★Drowsy★</strong>, to examine his patients’ dreams up close and personal.
    </dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="fragile"><strong>Mera Salamin</strong> (Voiced by Lindsay Sheppard)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>Short in terms of both temper and height, this museum tour guide doesn’t get along with anyone besides her gigantic bodyguard Indus. 
    Her personality is as icy as her stare. She seems oddly accident-prone, for some reason…</dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="BARRIER"><strong>Indus Tarbella</strong> (Voiced by Anthony Sardinha)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>Mera's incredibly loyal, buff, and dim-witted bodyguard.
      <br><br>
      His epithet, <strong><em>★BARRIER★</em></strong>, allows him to make, you guessed it, <strong><em>BARRIERS!</em></strong> 
    </dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="parapet"><strong>Percival 'Percy' King</strong> (Voiced by Sandra Espinoza)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>The main protagonist of the second arc, a police detective. 
    She spearheads the investigation over the Arsene Amulet burglary, which leads her to the backwater town of Redwood Run.
      <br><br>
      Her epithet, <strong>★Parapet★</strong>, gives her the ability to construct small, magical buildings using the material around her.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt><h2 id="goldbricker"><strong>Ramsey Murdoch</strong> (Voiced by William Sopp)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A freelance appraiser for the criminal underworld and a freelance artist in his off-time. 
    Ramsey is the guy to go to when you need to know how valuable whatever you just stole is. <br>Despite his seedy appearance, he’s actually a pretty reliable guy.
    <br><br>
       His epithet, <strong>★Goldbricker★</strong>, lets him turn anything he touches into gold. He prefers using this ability to prank people rather than making money.
    </dd> 
    <br><br>
    <dt><h2 id="sundial"><strong>Zora Salazar</strong> (Voiced by Dawn M. Bennett)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>A bounty-hunting cowgirl who's been sent to retrieve the Arsene Amulet.</dd>

  <blockquote cite= https://letterboxd.com/gravykfp/film/epithet-erased/>  
    Ludicrously endearing, endlessly adorable. 
    Honestly it’s not perfect but who cares ratings are subjective and nothing’s perfect anyway. 
    I adore every second of this and I need to watch it 7 more times.

  <h3><strong>The limits placed on this production underscore a refreshing, humors and surprisingly heartfelt adventure. </strong><br>★8/10 on IMDB by brankoburcksen, 22 Nov 2019</h3> 
  <blockquote cite= https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5274490/?ref_=tturv_perm_4>
    Everyone will first notice the limited animation, which determines right out the gate who this series appeals to, and I happen to be one of those. I never watched the table top RPG streams the creator played with his friends that it is based on, but I enjoyed the humorous take downs of popular video games and anime on his YouTube channel done in same style. He takes that to the next level with his first full fledge series.
  <br><br> 
    The voice acting carries a lot of the humorous and dramatic weight of the show to great effect. The limited movement along with the exaggerated poses and facial expressions at key moments sell what happens, but it is really the performances that bring any investment to the action, and the cast does a fantastic job of pulling that off.
  <br><br> 
    It took me a little while to get into the story, but it surprised me that there was genuine heart behind the proceedings instead of nonstop antics. Apart from Molly as the grounded, audience POV, everyone is some manner of oddball meant to befuddle her. However, they begin peel back layers as unexpected dynamics develop between the various factions vying for the amulet. Those surprise insights and heartfelt moments keep me hooked to happens next.

    Give Epithet Erased a watch for its unexpected style and more three dimensional characters than their appearance would have you believe.

  <h3><strong>Super Cute and Unique Show- Must Watch!</strong><br> ★10/10 on IMDB by crazycakesforever, 5 January 2020</h3>
  <blockquote cite=https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5385188/?ref_=tturv_perm_11>
    When I first started watching this show, I was thrown off by the lack of "animation" that you would usually see in TV productions. However, as I got past the first two episodes I started to enjoy Epithet Erased for it's lovable characters and unique storyline.
    <br><br> 
    The show is reminiscent of a DND campaign (as it was based off of one). Characters sometimes narrate their actions in third person. The first part of the story focuses on a girl named Molly Blyndeff, whose bumbling father left her in a museum overnight. Unfortunately for her, two conflicting heists happen to be occurring at the same time. Both the protagonists and antagonists caught my love for their quirks and personalities.
    <br><br> 
    It's hard to find a comparison for this show, as it feels one-of-a-kind. The art style, humor, and storyline are intriguing and will definitely make you laugh. If you have some time, I definitely recommend you watch this series and support the creators!

  <h3>★5/5 on goodreads by Deshawn Vasquez, December 15, 2022</h3>
  <blockquote cite= https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6969683940>  
    I liked <em>Epithet Erased</em> a lot, and while it's unfortunate that it can't live on as an animated series for the foreseeable future, I actually preferred <em>Prison of Plastic</em> to the original season, medium shift or not. A great balance of absurdism, wholesomeness and genuine drama. Plus, illustrations for the physical book and a full-cast recording for the audio is a great consolation, and I hope this does well enough to continue consistently this way.
