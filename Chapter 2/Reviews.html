    Ludicrously endearing, endlessly adorable. 
    Honestly it’s not perfect but who cares ratings are subjective and nothing’s perfect anyway. 
    I adore every second of this and I need to watch it 7 more times.

  <h3><strong>The limits placed on this production underscore a refreshing, humors and surprisingly heartfelt adventure. </strong><br>★8/10 on IMDB by brankoburcksen, 22 Nov 2019</h3>

    Everyone will first notice the limited animation, which determines right out the gate who this series appeals to, and I happen to be one of those. I never watched the table top RPG streams the creator played with his friends that it is based on, but I enjoyed the humorous take downs of popular video games and anime on his YouTube channel done in same style. He takes that to the next level with his first full fledge series.
  <br><br> 
    The voice acting carries a lot of the humorous and dramatic weight of the show to great effect. The limited movement along with the exaggerated poses and facial expressions at key moments sell what happens, but it is really the performances that bring any investment to the action, and the cast does a fantastic job of pulling that off.
  <br><br> 
    It took me a little while to get into the story, but it surprised me that there was genuine heart behind the proceedings instead of nonstop antics. Apart from Molly as the grounded, audience POV, everyone is some manner of oddball meant to befuddle her. However, they begin peel back layers as unexpected dynamics develop between the various factions vying for the amulet. Those surprise insights and heartfelt moments keep me hooked to happens next.

    Give Epithet Erased a watch for its unexpected style and more three dimensional characters than their appearance would have you believe.

  <h3><strong>Super Cute and Unique Show- Must Watch!</strong><br> ★10/10 on IMDB by crazycakesforever, 5 January 2020</h3>
  <blockquote cite=https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5385188/?ref_=tturv_perm_11>
    When I first started watching this show, I was thrown off by the lack of "animation" that you would usually see in TV productions. However, as I got past the first two episodes I started to enjoy Epithet Erased for it's lovable characters and unique storyline.
    <br><br> 
    The show is reminiscent of a DND campaign (as it was based off of one). Characters sometimes narrate their actions in third person. The first part of the story focuses on a girl named Molly Blyndeff, whose bumbling father left her in a museum overnight. Unfortunately for her, two conflicting heists happen to be occurring at the same time. Both the protagonists and antagonists caught my love for their quirks and personalities.
    <br><br> 
    It's hard to find a comparison for this show, as it feels one-of-a-kind. The art style, humor, and storyline are intriguing and will definitely make you laugh. If you have some time, I definitely recommend you watch this series and support the creators!

  <h3>★5/5 on goodreads by Deshawn Vasquez, December 15, 2022</h3>
  <blockquote cite= https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6969683940>  
    I liked <em>Epithet Erased</em> a lot, and while it's unfortunate that it can't live on as an animated series for the foreseeable future, I actually preferred <em>Prison of Plastic</em> to the original season, medium shift or not. A great balance of absurdism, wholesomeness and genuine drama. Plus, illustrations for the physical book and a full-cast recording for the audio is a great consolation, and I hope this does well enough to continue consistently this way.
