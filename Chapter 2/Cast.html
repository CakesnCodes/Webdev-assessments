    <br>
    <dd>A recently promoted Captain in the Banzai Blasters, who broke into the Sweet Jazz Museum with no real goal besides "stealing artifacts". Despite being a self-proclaimed evil villain, he's actually very kind and compassionate,

    <br>
    <dd>Short in terms of both temper and height, this museum tour guide doesn’t get along with anyone besides her gigantic bodyguard Indus.

    <br>
    <dt><h2 id="BARRIER"><strong>Indus Tarbella</strong> (Voiced by Anthony Sardinha)</h2></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>Mera's incredibly loyal, buff, and dim-witted bodyguard.</dd>

    <dt><h2 id="sundial"><strong>Zora Salazar</strong> (Voiced by Dawn M. Bennett)</h2></dt>
